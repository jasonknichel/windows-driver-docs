# Executable version numbers for audio drivers 

In the interest of ensuring quality and reliability of audio drivers shipped to Windows users, there are policies for evaluating executables in driver packages.

Executable files (.sys, .exe, .dll, .cpl) that are included as part of a driver package model need to include version numbering so that bugs and fixes and be tracked and verified.

The driver submission is rejected if the executable version number is missing, blank, nulled, or "0.0.0.0".

Learn more about how to add a version number to an executable file with [VERSIONINFO resource](/windows/desktop/menurc/versioninfo-resource).
