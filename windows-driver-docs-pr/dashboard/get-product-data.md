# Get product data

Use the following methods in *Microsoft Hardware APIs* to retrieve data for hardware products registered to your Dev Center Account. For an introduction to Microsoft Hardware APIs, including prerequisites for using the API, see [Manage hardware submissions using APIs](dashboard-api.md).

`https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v2.0/my/hardware/products/`

Before you can use these methods, the product must already exist in your Dev Center account. To create or manage submissions for products, see the methods in [Manage product submissions](manage-product-submissions.md).

| Method | URI | Description |
|--|--|--|
| GET | `https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v2.0/my/hardware/products/` | [Get data for all your products](get-all-products.md) |
| GET | `https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v2.0/my/hardware/products/{productID}` | [Get data for a specific product](get-a-product.md) |
| GET | `https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v2.0/my/hardware/products/{productID}/submissions` | [Get data for all submissions of a product](get-all-submissions.md) |
| GET | `https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v2.0/my/hardware/products/{productID}/submissions/{submissionId}` | [Get data for a specific submission of a product](get-a-submission.md) |

## Prerequisites

Complete all the [prerequisites](dashboard-api.md) for the Microsoft Hardware APIs before trying to use any of these methods.

## Data resources

The Microsoft Hardware APIs methods for getting product data use the following JSON data resources
