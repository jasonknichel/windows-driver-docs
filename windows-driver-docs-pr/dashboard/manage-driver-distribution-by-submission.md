# Manage driver distribution with shipping labels

After you create your hardware submissions and uploaded your driver packages, create shipping labels to distribute your drivers. You create a shipping label when you want to [Publish a driver to Windows Update](publish-a-driver-to-windows-update.md), for example. Shipping labels contain information about the distribution of your driver. Shipping label information includes:

- A name for the shipping label
- The destination for the driver package, such as Windows Update
- Driver delivery options, such as **Automatically delivered to all applicable systems**, or **Automatically delivered during Windows Upgrades**

Shipping labels allow you to:

- Publish your drivers to Windows Update
- Share your drivers with partners
- Publish drivers that are shared with you
- Publish drivers on behalf of your partners
