# Windows compatible products list

The [Windows compatible products list](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/hardware/search/cpl) is a comprehensive list of certified devices and systems. The Windows compatible products list has the following features and restrictions:

- Find devices and systems by filtering the list or by running a search for a specific product name.
- Search across all certified devices and systems for the entire catalog.
- Search for the product or marketing name and receive a verification report.
- Displays Declarative & Universal (D & U) status for all device classes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> System search does not support the Declarative & Universal (D & U) status field. Therefore, you must set the **D & U Status** search field dropdown to **All** to see system results.

## Search for marketing or product names

If you search using the **Marketing/Product Name** box, the compatible products list returns matching results in the product name, submission name, and marketing name fields. Consider these search recommendations:

- Limit your search to plain text, without quotes or wildcards.
- Any spaces between words are treated as **AND** expressions.
- Don't use any special characters or search-limiting terms. For example, don't use:

  - **OR**
  - **AND**
  - **""**
  - **\***
  - **?**

## Search for a company name

Limit your searches to plain text, without quotes or wildcards. For example, don't use:

- **OR**
- **AND**
- **""**
- **\***
- **?**

The search function will autocomplete results after you type five letters.

> [!NOTE]
> You may find that some companies are listed twice. This is a result of merging the previous database with Hardware Dev Center. Each entry is different, so it's best to search using the **Marketing/Product Name** field.
