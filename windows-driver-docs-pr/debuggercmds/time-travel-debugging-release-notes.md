# Time travel debugging release notes

:::image type="content" source="images/ttd-time-travel-debugging-logo.png" alt-text="Time travel debugging logo featuring a clock.":::

This topic provides information on what's new in Time Travel Debugging.

## 1.11.506

This is a minor release to coincide with the April 2025 release of WinDbg.

### Changed

- Clicking on a TTD position in the data model (i.e. in the Modules list) navigates to that position in the trace. (1.11.492)

  Note: The command window will not show the updated TTD position until the next step or run command is executed.

### Fixed

- Add process name to .out file when attaching to a PID to aid troubleshooting. (1.11.486)

## 1.11.481

We have revamped the !tt command to give you more powerful ways to navigate through your trace:
- Fractional percentages can be used to narrow down the search space (!tt 23.65)
- Find the previous/next time a register changes value (!tt br ebx)
- Find the previous/next time a memory range is accessed (!tt ba- [addr] [range])
- Find the previous/next time execution moves to a different module (!tt bm)
- Find the previous/next time execution moves to a specific module (!tt bm ntdll)

For more details see the [documentation](time-travel-debugging-extension-tt.md).

Some notable fixes:
- "Error: 64 bit value loses precision on conversion to number" messages when using `@$cursession.TTD.Data.Heap()` on 32-bit trace are gone.
- Help option parsing (`-?`, `-help`) is now correctly detected anywhere in the command line.
- `dx @$cursession.TTD.Calls()` no longer requires addresses to match the start of a function. Instead, the address will be mapped to the start of the closest matching function.
- TTD correctly reports target OS version from vertarget command.
- Using "-monitor" with a hosted service name no longer records unrelated hosted services.

### Added

- Register change breakpoints in TTD traces (1.11.431)

### Changed

- Fix recording of services by name using monitor mode (1.11.477)
- Capture actual target system's OS information for use by debugger (1.11.473)
- Fix the transfer of XMM registers between the emulator and CONTEXT (1.11.469)
- Allow call queries against addresses inside a function (1.11.459)
- Support symbols as addresses/sizes in !tt command line (1.11.454)
- Improve the consistency and extend the capabilities of TTD navigation commands (1.11.453)
- Improve module DB consistency in the face of corrupted data (1.11.430)

### Fixed

- Add process name to output when attaching to PID (1.11.486)
- TTD.Data.Heap() reports "Error: 64 bit value loses precision on conversion to number" in some cases (1.11.471)
- Improve the reliability of recording a process with shadow stacks enabled (1.11.466)
- Add module navigation via !tt bm and data model (1.11.462)
- Fix Some issues with command-line parsing. (1.11.444)
- Fix lodsd, load doubleword at address (zero out upper part of rax) (1.11.434)
- Fix some libfuzzer bugs (1.11.433)

## 1.11.429

This update of TTD contains a few bug fixes along with some internal changes to improve reliability.

Note: 1.11.410 introduced a regression in the emulation of the Intel/AMD LODSD instruction. A fix for this will come in the next release.

Fixes:
- Improve packet reading robustness and other misc changes to improve reliability.
- Fix a regression in emulating the AVX VBROADCAST[I/F]128 instruction.
- Fix the exception record access on ARM64 in newer builds of Windows.

## 1.11.410

Improved accessibility: Progress UI now properly scales with Text Size changes.

The ```@$cursession.TTD.Calls()``` command in the debugger now supports wildcards that match a large number of functions.
It is now possible to query for large numbers of functions (```@$cursession.TTD.Calls("kernel32!*")```).

Automation: A new ```-onMonitorReadyEvent``` command-line option indicates when the recording monitor (```-monitor``` switch)
is ready to record new processes.

Fixes:
- Fix some race conditions while initializing the recorder.
- Fix how we record syscalls so that breakpoints work correctly.
- Fix multiple issues related to module selective recording.

ARM64 fixes:
- Fixed a bug preventing TTD recording on plain ARM64v8.0 level CPUs.
- Improved the messaging when attempting to use on ARM64 a trace of an x86 or x64 process.

AMD/Intel fixes (includes some issues reported by Google):
- Fixed incorrect emulation of LODS: Instead of zeroing out the unused bits of RAX they are now correctly preserved.
- Fixed emulation of "pop ax" instruction in x86/x64 processes, which was incorrectly zeroing the upper bits
  of the full register (e.g. "pop ax" cleared the upper bits of rax).
- Direct emulation of the XGETBV instruction (faster).
- Direct emulation of all AVX512 SIMD moves (faster).

## 1.11.316

Fixed a regression that was causing occasional crashes when recording programs with long uninterrupted data-heavy instruction sequences.

ARM64 fixes:
- Recording in ARM64 processes that have the PAC feature enabled is now supported.
- Fixed the ANDS and TST instructions, which were failing to clear the carry and overflow flags.

AMD/Intel fixes:
- Fixed bug where TTD incorrectly emulated "xchg r8,rax" and "xchg r8w,ax" as NOP.

## 1.11.304

TTD now implements and publishes publicly an API to control the recorder from within the live recorded process. Documentation and a sample can be found in [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/WinDbg-Samples/tree/HEAD/TTD).

TTD can now inject itself with recording turned off using the new `-recordMode` switch. By default TTD uses `-recordMode Automatic` which causes all threads to be recorded. If `-recordMode Manual` is specified then TTD injects into the target process but doesn't record anything until told to do so through an API call.

Recording can now be restricted to a specific set of modules using the `-module` switch. In some scenarios this can result in substantially faster recording and smaller trace files. More than one `-module` switch may be specified.

Matching record and replay components are now included in the distribution. In the event of an incompatibility between the debugger and the command line recorder, or a replay bug, the replay components can be copied into the debugger install as a workaround until a new debugger is released.

The installed file location can be found in PowerShell by doing the following:

```
ls (Get-AppxPackage | where Name -eq 'Microsoft.TimeTravelDebugging').InstallLocation
```

### Added

- Add -recordmode switch to enable injection without automatic recording (1.11.296)
- Add -module switch and use to create SR config (1.11.291)
- Project custom data recorded by the in-process API to data model (1.11.286)
- Add a new TTDLiveRecorder.dll and wire it up along with TTDRecordCPU.dll (1.11.283)
- Add replay components to MSIX & fix SDK lookup (1.11.265)

### Changed

none

### Fixed

- Work around [a bug](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/4236) in the nlohmann JSON serializer, which is used in some internal tooling (1.11.281)
  - Contributed [a fix](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/4237) to that library that will become available in [a future release](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/milestone/49?closed=1).

- Fix a regression that may cause trace file corruption in some cases (1.11.264)

### Known issues

- On ARM64, the compiler is failing to tail-call a number of high-frequency functions which in extreme cases can cause the recorder to run out of stack space and crash.

## 1.11.261

Notable changes in this release include:
- [ARM64] Fixed the behavior of the `SXTL`, `SQXTN2`, `SQXTUN2`, `UQXTN2`, `XTN2` and `TRN1` instructions when the destination register is used as a source.
- [ARM64] Fixed an issue that caused the debugger to show SIMD registers with their lower 64 bits duplicated into the high 64 bits.
- [AMD64] AVX512 emulation fixes for AMD's Zen4 processors (registers were getting corrupted).

### Changed

- Implement a new versioning system specifically for the emulator. (1.11.260)
