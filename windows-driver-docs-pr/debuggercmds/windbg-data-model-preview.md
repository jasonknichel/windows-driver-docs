# WinDbg - Data Model Menu

This section describes how to work with the data model menu in the WinDbg debugger.

## New Model Query

Use the New Model Query dialog to create a new model query. You can put anything here you'd put into a normal `dx` command.

For example, specify `Debugger.Sessions` to examine the debugger sessions objects.

For general information about the debugger objects refer to [dx (Display Debugger Object Model Expression)](dx--display-visualizer-variables-.md).

Use LINQ queries to dig deeper into the session. This query shows the top 5 processes running the most threads. 

```dbgcmd
Debugger.Sessions.First().Processes.Select(p => new { Name = p.Name, ThreadCount = p.Threads.Count() }).OrderByDescending(p => p.ThreadCount),5
```

## Data Model Explorer

Use the data model explorer to quickly browse every data model object in the `Debugger` namespace.

### Display Mode

Use display mode to toggle between grid, hierarchy, and graph display modes. You can right-click column headers to hide or show more columns.

Grid mode can be useful to dig down in the objects. For example, here is the previous top threads query in grid view.

Clicking on any underlined item will open a new tab and run a query to display that information.

This query shows the devices in the plug and play device tree grouped by the name of the physical device object's driver for a kernel session.

```dbgcmd
Debugger.Sessions.First().Devices.DeviceTree.Flatten(n => n.Children).GroupBy(n => n.PhysicalDeviceObject->Driver->DriverName.ToDisplayString()) 
```

### Change Query

Edit the query text box to change the query that is used in the active data model window.

### Change Window or Tab Title

New generic data model windows are given `Data Model` title, but the title can be customized as desired by invoking the `Change Title` context menu item from either the tab or window title pane.

:::image type="content" source="images/windbgx-data-model-custom-titles.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Data model explore window presenting two tabs with custom titles in WinDbg.":::

> [!NOTE]
> Title cannot be empty nor can it contain semicolons.
