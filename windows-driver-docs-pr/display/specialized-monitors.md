# Head-mounted and specialized monitors

Windows has built-in support for head-mounted displays (HMDs) and other kinds of specialized display scenarios. Only custom compositors can address these displays because the Desktop Windows Manager (DWM), which is the standard Windows system compositor, ignores them. In addition, HMDs and specialized displays are given the following properties by Windows:

* Since DWM ignores them, the Windows shell can't be extended to these displays (for example, wallpaper, desktop icons, taskbar).
* The OS doesn't automatically power them on while the PC is in use.
* They don't receive touch or mouse input.
* Apps can acquire them for dedicated control and presentation, subject to an access model.

Windows Mixed Reality headsets are one example of HMDs controlled by a custom compositor. Partner IHVs can build similar solutions using this documentation.
