# Testing and debugging TDR during driver development

This article describes TDR (timeout detection and recovery) testing and debugging strategies for graphics display driver developers.

## TDR tests in WHLK

The [Windows Hardware Lab Kit](/windows-hardware/test/hlk/) (WHLK) contains TDR-specific tests that driver developers can use for testing and debugging purposes. For example, developers can manually trigger a GPU TDR using the [**SimulatePreemption TDR**](/windows-hardware/test/hlk/testref/86be5032-cfcd-4ee5-a515-0e3ebc0cb6f4). See [**Device.Graphics**](/windows-hardware/test/hlk/testref/device-graphics) for more information about the various TDR-related tests.

## TDR registry keys for testing and debugging

Developers can use the following TDR-related registry keys for testing or debugging purposes *only during the driver development process*.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend that end users not manipulate these registry keys. They should also not be manipulated by applications outside of targeted testing or debugging during driver development.

### TdrLevel

Specifies the initial level of recovery.

```registry
KeyPath   : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers
KeyValue  : TdrLevel
ValueType : REG_DWORD
ValueData : TdrLevelXxx (see the following table)
```

Where TdrLevel*Xxx* can be one of the following values:

| Value | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| TdrLevelOff (0) | Detection disabled |
| TdrLevelBugcheck (1) | Bug check on detected timeout; for example, no recovery. |
| TdrLevelRecoverVGA (2) | Recover to VGA (not implemented). |
| TdrLevelRecover (3) | Recover on timeout (default value). |

### TdrDelay

Specifies the number of seconds that the GPU can delay the preempt request from the GPU scheduler. TdrDelay is effectively the timeout threshold.

```registry
KeyPath   : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers
KeyValue  : TdrDelay
ValueType : REG_DWORD
ValueData : Number of seconds to delay. The default value is 2 seconds.
```

### TdrDdiDelay

Specifies the number of seconds that the OS allows threads to leave the driver. After a specified time, the OS bug-checks the computer with the code VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE (0x116).

```registry
KeyPath   : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers
KeyValue  : TdrDdiDelay
ValueType : REG_DWORD
ValueData : Number of seconds to leave the driver. The default value is 5 seconds.
```

### TdrDebugMode

Specifies the debugging-related behavior of the TDR process. The default value is TDR_DEBUG_MODE_RECOVER_NO_PROMPT, which indicates not to break into the debugger.

```registry
KeyPath   : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers
KeyValue  : TdrDebugMode
ValueType : REG_DWORD
ValueData : TDR_DEBUG_MODE_XXX (see the following table)
```

| Value | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| TDR_DEBUG_MODE_OFF (0) | Break to kernel debugger before the recovery to allow investigation of the timeout. |
| TDR_DEBUG_MODE_IGNORE_TIMEOUT (1) | Ignore any timeout. |
| TDR_DEBUG_MODE_RECOVER_NO_PROMPT (2) | Recover without breaking into the debugger (default value). |
| TDR_DEBUG_MODE_RECOVER_UNCONDITIONAL (3) | Recover even if some recovery conditions aren't met (for example, recover on consecutive timeouts). |

### TdrLimitTime

Specifies the default time within which a specific number of TDRs (specified by the **TdrLimitCount** key) are allowed without crashing the computer.

```registry
KeyPath   : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers
KeyValue  : TdrLimitTime
ValueType : REG_DWORD
ValueData : Number of seconds before crashing. The default value is 60 seconds.
```

### TdrLimitCount

Specifies the default number of TDRs (0x117) that are allowed during the time specified by the **TdrLimitTime** key without crashing the computer.

```registry
KeyPath   : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers
KeyValue  : TdrLimitCount
ValueType : REG_DWORD
ValueData : Number of TDRs before crashing. The default value is 5.
```

### TdrTestMode

Reserved. Don't use.

```registry
KeyPath   : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers
KeyValue  : TdrTestMode
ValueType : REG_DWORD
ValueData : Do not use.
```

### TdrDodPresentDelay

Specifies the number of seconds allowed for the kernel-mode display-only driver's (KMDOD) [**DxgkDdiPresentDisplayOnly**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_presentdisplayonly) function to complete an asynchronous present by reporting progress to **pfnPresentDisplayOnlyProgress** (which is passed in the [**DXGKARG_PRESENT_DISPLAYONLY**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_present_displayonly) structure).

```registry
KeyPath   : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers
KeyValue  : TdrDodPresentDelay
ValueType : REG_DWORD
ValueData : Number of seconds allowed for **DxgkDdiPresentDisplayOnly** to complete an asynchronous present. The default value is 2 seconds. (Min: 1, Max: 15 * 60 = 15 minutes). This value is for debugging purposes only.
```

### TdrDodVSyncDelay

Specifies the number of seconds the V-sync watchdog waits for a V-sync signal to be reported before triggering a TDR in a KMDOD.

```registry
KeyPath   : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers
KeyValue  : TdrDodVSyncDelay
ValueType : REG_DWORD
ValueData : Number of seconds that the V-sync watchdog waits for a V-sync to be reported before a TDR occurs with Kernel Mode Display-Only Drivers. Drivers are expected to report V-sync interrupts at the cadence of the display mode refresh rate. The default value is 2 seconds. (Min: 1s, Max: 15 * 60 = 15 minutes). This value is for debugging purposes only.
```
