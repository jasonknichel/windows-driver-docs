# Finding and opening a HID collection

This article describes how user-mode applications and kernel-mode drivers find and open a top-level [HID collection](hid-collections.md).

## User-mode application

Microsoft Windows provides device installation routines (**SetupDi***Xxx* functions) to find and identify the HIDClass devices. Windows provides other Win32 functions to initialize and connect to a HID collection.

After a user-mode application is loaded, it does the following sequence of operations:

- Calls **[HidD_GetHidGuid](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/hidsdi/nf-hidsdi-hidd_gethidguid)** to obtain the system-defined GUID for HIDClass devices.

- Calls **[SetupDiGetClassDevs](/windows/win32/api/setupapi/nf-setupapi-setupdigetclassdevsw)** to obtain a handle to an opaque device information set that describes the device interfaces supported by all the [HID collections](hid-collections.md) currently installed in the system. The application should specify DIGCF_PRESENT and DIGCF_DEVICEINTERFACE in the *Flags* parameter that is passed to **SetupDiGetClassDevs**.

- Calls **[SetupDiEnumDeviceInterfaces](/windows/win32/api/setupapi/nf-setupapi-setupdienumdeviceinterfaces)** repeatedly to retrieve all the available interface information.

- Calls **[SetupDiGetDeviceInterfaceDetail](/windows/win32/api/setupapi/nf-setupapi-setupdigetdeviceinterfacedetaila)** to format interface information for each collection as a SP_INTERFACE_DEVICE_DETAIL_DATA structure. The **DevicePath** member of this structure contains the user-mode name that the application uses with the Win32 function **[CreateFile](/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea)** to obtain a file handle to a HID collection.

- Calls **[CreateFile](/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea)** to obtain a file handle to a HID collection.

## Kernel-mode driver

If a kernel-mode driver is a function or filter driver, it attaches a device object to the HID collection's device stack. The driver has to only use a create request to open the device.

If the driver isn't a function or filter driver, it typically uses [Plug and Play notification](../kernel/pnp-notification-overview.md) to find a collection. After the driver finds a collection, it uses a create request to open the collection.
