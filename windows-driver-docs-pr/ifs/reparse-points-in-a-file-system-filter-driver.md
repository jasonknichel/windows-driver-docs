# Security considerations for reparse points

A filter driver that processes reparse points must be aware of the risk that an application might create invalid reparse points.

To ensure the strictest security, a driver that handles reparse points must ensure that the data contents of the reparse point itself are verifiable. This verification can be done through a secure checksum, encrypted contents, or some other mechanism that ensures unprivileged applications can't create invalid reparse points.

For example, a filter driver might require that its reparse points be encrypted using a password shared between an application (or the local security authority, for example), and the driver. The shared password ensures that the data contents of the reparse point are valid.

Otherwise, a malicious application could create reparse points that have invalid reparse point information. In this case, the file system filter driver must be prepared to handle invalid reparse point data, including:

* Self-referential data (data that creates reference loops that might cause some sort of overflow, for example)
* Data overflow issues
* Invalid data contents
