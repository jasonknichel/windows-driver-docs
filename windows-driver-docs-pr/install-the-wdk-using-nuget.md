# Install the WDK using NuGet

This article describes how to use NuGet to install the Windows Driver Kit on your computer. NuGet is a popular package manager, used for packaging and distributing software. For more information, see [What is NuGet?](/nuget/what-is-nuget/).

## Windows Drivers Kit Overview

Windows Driver Kit (WDK) is a software tool set used to develop, test, and deploy Windows drivers. The content included in the WDK can be categorized into five unique types: Headers, Libraries, Samples, Tools, and Templates.

The WDK is released in three different distributions, with different installation options.

**Windows Driver Kit (WDK)**: The WDK is available as a traditional msi based package. It requires Visual Studio to be installed and the WDK is installed to `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Windows Kits\`. For information on downloading and installing the WDK, see [Download the Windows Driver Kit (WDK)](.\download-the-wdk.md).

**Enterprise Windows Drivers Kit (EWDK)**: The EWDK is shipped as a standalone ISO, which includes the command line compiler build tools, the SDK and the WDK. The EWDK is a standalone self-contained command-line environment. To get started, just mount the ISO and run LaunchBuildEnv. For information on how to download and use the EWDK, visit [Download the Windows Driver Kit (WDK)](.\download-the-wdk.md).

**Windows Drivers Kit NuGet Package**: The WDK NuGet package consists of essential libraries, headers, DLL, tools, and metadata used for building Windows drivers that are shared and supported by modern CI/CD pipelines. The official release of the WDK NuGet package is now available on nuget.org. The latest release version is *10.0.26100.3323*. For information on the latest release of the WDK, SDK, and Visual Studio, see [Kit versioning](./download-the-wdk.md#kit-versioning).

Developers can access and integrate Windows Driver Kit (WDK) NuGet packages directly from Visual Studio via the NuGet Package Manager. By utilizing these packages, driver developers can seamlessly install essential build tools into their projects, facilitating a streamlined and efficient process for acquiring WDK. Moreover, the use of WDK NuGet packages allows for more frequent updates and releases, and they can be easily integrated into build systems within CI/CD pipelines. For more information, see [Install and manage packages in Visual Studio using the NuGet Package Manager](/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-visual-studio/).

Here are the links to the x64 and ARM64 WDK NuGet packages available on nuget.org.
