# INF AddComClass directive

An AddComClass is used within a com-server-install-section and registers a COM class. A COM server must define one or more classes. This section is supported for Windows 11 version 24H2 and later.

```inf
[com-server-install-section]

AddComClass = {clsid-guid}[, flags[, com-class-install-section]]
```

## Entries

### clsid-guid

Specifies the GUID value that identifies the COM class. Use an explicit GUID value of the form {nnnnnnnn-nnnn-nnnn-nnnn-nnnnnnnnnnnn} or a %strkey% token defined to {nnnnnnnn-nnnn-nnnn-nnnn-nnnnnnnnnnnn} in a Strings section of the INF file.

### flags

Specifies extra flags for the AddComClass directive. The flags are reserved for future use and should be left blank or set to zero.

### com-class-install-section

References an INF-writer-defined section that contains information for registering the COM class. The *com-class-install-section* field is optional. For more information, see the following Remarks section, and for more information on COM classes in general, see [COM Clients and Servers](/windows/win32/com/com-clients-and-servers).

## Remarks

The system setup code registers a COM class specified by clsid-guid.

Each AddComClass directive in an INF-writer-defined COM server install section can reference an INF-writer-defined com-class-install-section elsewhere in the INF file. Each INF-writer-defined section name must be unique within the INF file and must follow the general rules for defining section names. For more information about these rules, see [General Syntax Rules for INF Files](general-syntax-rules-for-inf-files.md).

An AddComClass directive can refer to a named com-class-install-section elsewhere in the INF. Each such section has the following form:

```inf
[com-class-install-section]

[Description    = COM-class-description]
[ThreadingModel = threading-model-enum]
```

### Description

Description is an optional value describing the COM class.

### ThreadingModel

Threading model is optional and defines what threading model COM server supports.

| ThreadingModel | Description |
|---|---|
| Apartment | Single-threaded apartment |
| Both | Single-threaded or multithreaded apartment |
| Free | Multithreaded apartment |
| Neutral | Neutral apartment |

> [!NOTE]
> If threading model is not specified, the server is loaded into the first apartment that was initialized in the process.  For more information, see [InProcServer32](/windows/win32/com/inprocserver32).

## Example

```inf
[Device_Install.COM]
AddComServer   = VendorComServer,, VendorComServer_Inst

[VendorComServer_Inst]
ServerType     = 1 ; in-proc
ServerBinary   = %13%\Vendor_ComServer.dll
AddComClass    = {bb2b85ab-9473-42e5-8d1a-0f01d3879879}
AddComClass    = {f1baf99b-d28a-4ea3-b652-355da082d260}, 0, Vendor_ComClass_WithThreadingModel_Inst

[Vendor_ComClass_WithThreadingModel_Inst]
Description    = %Vendor_ComClass_Desc%
ThreadingModel = Both

[Strings]
%Vendor_ComClass_Desc%="Vendor COM class"
```
