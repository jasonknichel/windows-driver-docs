# Registering for Notification of Device Interface Arrival and Device Removal

This topic describes how a user-mode application or driver registers for notification of device interface arrival and device removal.

If you are following this procedure in a UMDF 2 driver, see [Using Device Interfaces](../wdf/using-device-interfaces.md) for a code example.

Typically, a user-mode component calls [**CM_Register_Notification**](/windows/win32/api/cfgmgr32/nf-cfgmgr32-cm_register_notification) to find a device interface, and then sends I/O requests to the interface. To do so, the component registers for both **CM_NOTIFY_FILTER_TYPE_DEVICEINTERFACE** and **CM_NOTIFY_FILTER_TYPE_DEVICEHANDLE**, for notification of device interface arrivals and device removals respectively. The calling sequence might look like the following.

**Registering for Notification of Device Interface Arrival and Device Removal**

1. Call [**CM_Register_Notification**](/windows/win32/api/cfgmgr32/nf-cfgmgr32-cm_register_notification) with **CM_NOTIFY_FILTER_TYPE_DEVICEINTERFACE** to register for device interface arrival notifications. When future interfaces in the specified class arrive, the system notifies your component.
2. Because the interface you want to send I/O to might already be present on the system, call [**CM_Get_Device_Interface_List**](/windows/win32/api/cfgmgr32/nf-cfgmgr32-cm_get_device_interface_lista) or [**SetupDiGetClassDevs**](/windows/win32/api/setupapi/nf-setupapi-setupdigetclassdevsw) to retrieve a list of existing interfaces.
   **Note**  If an interface arrives between step 1 and step 2, the interface is listed twice, from the registration in step 1 and the list of interfaces in step 2.
3. Once you find your desired interface, call [**CreateFile**](/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea) to open a handle for the device.
4. After successfully creating a device handle in step 3, call [**CM_Register_Notification**](/windows/win32/api/cfgmgr32/nf-cfgmgr32-cm_register_notification) a second time. This time, register for notifications of type **CM_NOTIFY_FILTER_TYPE_DEVICEHANDLE**, and provide the new device handle as the handle for which to receive notifications. When the device represented by the interface receives a query remove request, the system notifies your component.

5. Use this table as you implement your device handle notification callback.

|Action value the callback receives|What your component should do|
|---|---|
|**CM_NOTIFY_ACTION_DEVICEQUERYREMOVE**|Call [**CloseHandle**](/windows/win32/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle) to close the device handle. If you do not do this, your open handle prevents the query remove of this device from succeeding.|
|**CM_NOTIFY_ACTION_DEVICEQUERYREMOVEFAILED**|The query remove failed, so the device and its interface are still valid. To continue sending I/O to the interface, open a new handle to it. The notification registration on the device via the original handle remains valid even though that handle has been closed, so there is no need to unregister that notification registration and create a new registration under the new handle to the device interface. <br/><br/> Note that if you register for notifications on a device that is in the process of being query removed after the **CM_NOTIFY_ACTION_DEVICEQUERYREMOVE** notifications have been sent, you may receive a **CM_NOTIFY_ACTION_DEVICEQUERYREMOVEFAILED** notification without first receiving a **CM_NOTIFY_ACTION_DEVICEQUERYREMOVE** notification.|
|**CM_NOTIFY_ACTION_DEVICEREMOVEPENDING**|Call [**CM_Unregister_Notification**](/windows/win32/api/cfgmgr32/nf-cfgmgr32-cm_unregister_notification) to unregister the notifications for your handle. You must do this from a deferred routine.  See the **Remarks** section of [**CM_Unregister_Notification**](/windows/win32/api/cfgmgr32/nf-cfgmgr32-cm_unregister_notification) for more information.  If you still have an open handle to the device, call [**CloseHandle**](/windows/win32/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle) to close the device handle.|
|**CM_NOTIFY_ACTION_DEVICEREMOVECOMPLETE**|Call [**CM_Unregister_Notification**](/windows/win32/api/cfgmgr32/nf-cfgmgr32-cm_unregister_notification) to unregister the notifications for your handle. You must do this from a deferred routine.  See the **Remarks** section of [**CM_Unregister_Notification**](/windows/win32/api/cfgmgr32/nf-cfgmgr32-cm_unregister_notification) for more information.  If you still have an open handle to the device, call [**CloseHandle**](/windows/win32/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle) to close the device handle.|

6. Once you are finished with the device, call [**CM_Unregister_Notification**](/windows/win32/api/cfgmgr32/nf-cfgmgr32-cm_unregister_notification) to unregister the interface notification callback that you registered in step 1.

A UMDF 2 driver might perform steps 1-4 in the driver's [*EvtDevicePrepareHardware*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdevice/nc-wdfdevice-evt_wdf_device_prepare_hardware) callback routine, and step 6 in one of the driver's device removal callback routines.
