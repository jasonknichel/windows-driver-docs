# System-defined device setup classes available to vendors

Use the following list to select the right predefined values to use for the **Class** and **ClassGuid** entries in the [Version Section](inf-version-section.md) of the driver's INF file.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're looking for info on reserved classes and GUIDs, see [System-Defined Device Setup Classes Reserved for System Use](system-defined-device-setup-classes-reserved-for-system-use.md).

To see how these entries appear in an INF file, check out [cdrom.inf](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/blob/aaeca58c5e7b67740a603a3150db225670b42bb6/storage/class/cdrom/src/cdrom.inf#L7-L8) in the [Windows driver samples](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples) repo.

Unless otherwise noted, you can use entries in the following list to install device drivers on Windows 2000 and later.
