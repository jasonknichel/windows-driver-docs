# ACPI BIOS

The integrated power management features supported by Microsoft Windows operating systems are available only on computers that have an Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) BIOS.

Windows only supports a computer with an ACPI-compliant BIOS that is dated January 1, 1999 or later. Device Manager shows whether an individual computer supports ACPI. Check the driver information for the **Computer** device category.

For more information about ACPI, see the [ACPI 5.0 specification](https://uefi.org/specifications).
