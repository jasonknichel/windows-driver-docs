# Introduction to Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs)

A driver of a physical device that receives interrupts registers one or more interrupt service routines (ISR) to service the interrupts. The system calls the ISR each time it receives that interrupt.

PCI devices can generate *message-signaled interrupts*. A device generates a message-signaled interrupt by writing a data value to a particular address. Windows supports both line-based and message-signaled interrupts.

The system supports two different types of ISRs:

- The driver can register an [*InterruptService*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-kservice_routine) routine to handle line-based or message-signaled interrupts. The system passes a driver-supplied context value.

- The driver can register an [*InterruptMessageService*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-kmessage_service_routine) routine to handle message-signaled interrupts. The system passes both a driver-supplied context value and the messageÂ ID of the interrupt message.

For more information about registering an InterruptService or InterruptMessageService routine to service the device's interrupts, see [Introduction to Message-Signaled Interrupts](./introduction-to-message-signaled-interrupts.md).
