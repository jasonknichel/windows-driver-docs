# Power manager

The power manager is responsible for managing power usage for the system. It administers the system-wide power policy and tracks the path of power IRPs through the system.

The power manager requests power operations by sending [**IRP_MJ_POWER**](./irp-mj-power.md) requests to drivers. A request can specify a new power state or can query whether a change in power state is feasible.

When :::no-loc text="sleep, hibernation":::, or :::no-loc text="shut down"::: is required, the power manager requests the appropriate power action by sending an **IRP_MJ_POWER** request to each leaf node in the device tree. The power manager considers the following conditions:

- System activity level

- System battery level

- :::no-loc text="Sleep, hibernation":::, or :::no-loc text="shut down"::: requests from applications

- User actions, such as pressing the power button

- Control panel settings
