# Introduction to the NetAdapterCx data path

In the NetAdapterCx model, network data is represented by packet descriptors and transferred through packet queues. The OS and the client driver transfer the packet descriptors to each other using a set of ring buffers associated with each packet queue.

The following video [Network Adapter Class Extension: Data Path](https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=cdb34b61-1a38-41a3-a6f1-8245cb73a179) introduces the data path model in NetAdapterCx.
