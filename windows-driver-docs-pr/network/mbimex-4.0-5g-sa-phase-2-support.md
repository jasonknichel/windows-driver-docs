# MBIMEx 4.0 – 5G SA Phase 2 support

> [!NOTE]
> The release of MBIMEx 4.0, which includes 5G network slicing using URSP rules on Windows laptops, is still on hold. This hold also applies to IHV, OEM, and other partner testing involving the special capability mentioned in Microsoft documentation. We continue to welcome signals, use cases, and opportunities from our partners and will continue to reevaluate this decision in the coming semesters. 

By default, Windows 11, version 22H2 uses MBIMEx 3.0 as the highest supported MBIMEx version by the host.
