# What's New in WPD

This topic summarizes the new features and improvements for Windows Portable Devices (WPD).

## The NetMon Tool

The Network Monitor tool, also known as *NetMon.exe* tool, is a Windows-based application that you can use to view traces from WPD components. This tool replaces *WpdMon.exe* which had shipped in previous versions of the operating system.
