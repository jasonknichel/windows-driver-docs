# Specifying paper sizes

[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

Unidrv supports three categories of paper sizes--standard paper sizes, vendor-defined paper sizes, and user-defined paper sizes.

## Standard paper sizes

Standard paper sizes are those that are commonly supported by most printers. The dimensions of these paper sizes are predefined. For more information, see [Supporting standard paper sizes](supporting-standard-paper-sizes.md).

### Vendor-defined paper sizes

Vendor-defined paper sizes (also called nonstandard paper sizes) are defined by a printer vendor, within a printer's GPD file. For more information, see [Supporting vendor-defined paper sizes](supporting-vendor-defined-paper-sizes.md).

## User-defined paper sizes

User-defined paper sizes (also called customized paper sizes) are defined by system administrators using the system's print folder, and thus are system-specific. For more information, see [Supporting User-defined paper sizes](supporting-user-defined-paper-sizes.md).

For information about how to use the system locale to specify a default paper size, see [Referencing locales](referencing-locales.md).
