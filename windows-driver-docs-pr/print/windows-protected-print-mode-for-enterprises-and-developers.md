# Windows protected print mode for enterprises and developers

Windows protected print mode creates peace of mind for enterprise administrators by adding security benefits and completely removing the need for any driver management. When Windows protected print mode is enabled, printers will "just work".

## Security

Windows protected print mode prevents the installation of third-party drivers and enables additional security features to help make environments more secure. Windows protected print mode would mitigate over half of past reported security issues for Windows print.  

- Module blocking

- Per-user XPS rendering

- Lower privileges for common spooler tasks

- Binary mitigations

## Reliability and Compatibility

Windows protected print mode creates a reliable and consistent experience across a fleet of PCs regardless of manufacturer or model.

- Moving to a standard reduces risks of support calls and total cost of ownership and troubleshooting issues is simpler.

- Differentiation and unique features are still available via [Print Support Apps (PSA)](../devapps/print-support-app-design-guide.md).

- Ensures all printers work with PCs of any architecture.

- Removes the need to keep drivers up to date.
