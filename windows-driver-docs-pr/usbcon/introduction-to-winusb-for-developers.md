# Introduction to WinUSB for developers

As a driver developer, understanding WinUSB (Windows USB) can significantly streamline your development process, especially when working with USB devices. WinUSB is a generic driver included with Windows that allows you to communicate with USB devices without the need to write a custom driver. This can save you time, reduce complexity, and ensure compatibility across different Windows versions.

## Key Benefits of Using WinUSB

1. **Simplified Development**:

   - **Ease of Use**: WinUSB abstracts much of the complexity involved in USB communication, making it easier for you to interact with USB devices.
   - **No Custom Driver Needed**: For many USB devices, WinUSB can be used directly, eliminating the need to write and maintain a custom driver.

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:

   - **Standardized Interface**: WinUSB provides a standardized interface for USB communication, which can be beneficial for ensuring compatibility across different Windows versions.

1. **Time and Cost Efficiency**:

   - **Reduced Development Time**: Using WinUSB can significantly reduce the time required to develop and test a USB driver.
   - **Lower Maintenance Costs**: Since WinUSB is maintained by Microsoft, you can rely on it being updated and supported, reducing long-term maintenance costs.

1. **Access to USB Features**:

   - **Full USB Functionality**: WinUSB supports a wide range of USB features, including bulk transfers, control transfers, interrupt transfers, and isochronous transfers.

## What You Can Accomplish with WinUSB

1. **Device Communication**:

   - **Data Transfer**: Send and receive data to and from a USB device using bulk, control, interrupt, or isochronous transfers.
   - **Control Requests**: Send control requests to configure the device or retrieve information.

1. **Device Configuration**:

   - **Setting Configuration**: Configure the USB device by selecting configurations, interfaces, and alternate settings.
   - **Endpoint Management**: Manage endpoints for data transfer.

1. **Device Enumeration**:

   - **Device Identification**: Enumerate and identify USB devices connected to the system.
   - **Descriptor Retrieval**: Retrieve device descriptors, configuration descriptors, interface descriptors, and endpoint descriptors.

1. **Custom Applications**:

   - **User-Mode Applications**: Develop user-mode applications that communicate with USB devices using the WinUSB API.
   - **Firmware Updates**: Implement firmware update mechanisms for USB devices.

1. **Testing and Debugging**:

   - **Prototyping**: Quickly prototype USB device communication to test hardware functionality.
   - **Debugging**: Use WinUSB to debug communication issues between the host and the USB device.

## Components of WinUSB

WinUSB includes:

- A kernel-mode driver (winusb.sys)
- A user-mode dynamic link library (winusb.dll) that exposes WinUSB functions described in [winusb.h](/windows/win32/api/winusb#functions). You can use these functions to manage USB devices with user-mode software.

By default, winusb.sys is installed in the device's kernel-mode stack as an upper filter driver. Apps communicate with the device's UMDF function driver to issue read, write, or device I/O control requests. In this configuration, winusb.sys serves as the device stack's Plug and Play and power owner. You can also install winusb.sys as the function driver for a USB device.

## Getting Started with WinUSB

This section includes information on:

- Selecting the correct driver for a device
- Using WinUSB to communicate with USB devices
- Installing winusb.sys as the function driver for a USB device

You will also find detailed code examples that show how apps and USB devices communicate.

> [!NOTE]
> WinUSB supports isochronous transfers starting in Windows 8.
